Efficiency

Given an array of N integers with initial values, we want to execute on it a sequence of M events of the following types:

Event of type 0: assign 0 to all the elements of the array.
Event of type 1: increment all the elements of the array.

Input:
The integer N followed by the N integers of the array. Subsequently, the integer M followed by the M events you want to execute. You can assume that 1≤N, M≤2x10^5 and that the initial values of the array elements are between 0 and 1000.

Output: 
A sequence of N integers denoting the final state of the array.
